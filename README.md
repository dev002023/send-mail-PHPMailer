# send-mail-PHPMailer

It is a simple code for sending emails. I have used the PHPMailer library and used the Gmail SMTP host. like as 

 $mail->Host       = 'smtp.gmail.com';   
 
And use the email and app password to authenticate the Gmail SMTP. if do not have your app password you can click here

and generate your app password.
