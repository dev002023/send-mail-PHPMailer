# send-mail-PHPMailer

It is a simple code for sending emails. I have used the PHPMailer library and used the Gmail SMTP host. like as 

$mail->Host = 'smtp.gmail.com';   
 
And use the email and app password to authenticate the Gmail SMTP. if do not have your app password you can <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en">Click Here</a> and generate your app password.
